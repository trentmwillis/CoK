Outline for Development:
1. Get working display and menubar (DONE)

2. Add basic functionality: generate images and allow character to move (DONE)
	-Images that need to generate: city, buildings, player
	-Images:
		City = 1900px x 1080px, urban colors
		Buildings = 100px x 100px, lots of windows and only one entrance
		Player 20px x 20px, refer to FF4 and Chrono Trigger sprites
	-Movement of character will be tied to a KeyListener using a KeyPressed event
	
3. Add in other characters (NPCs, Guards, Shopkeepers) (DONE)
4. Add in items (DONE)
5. Add interactivity system (DONE)
6. Create buying/selling system (ALMOST DONE)
7. Create functionality for "robbing" the buildings (JUST STARTED)
8. Create save/load file system


In this version:
	-Added in ability to "speak" with NPCs
	-Add in NPCs/Guards/Shopkeepers and have them walking around the map

In this version:
	-Added collision detection for player on other characters and buildings
	-Added functionality to pause game

In this version:
	-Added interactivity with NPCs and Shopkeepers
		-Shopkeepers display an option dialog with the options "buy", "sell" or "no thanks"
		-NPCs display a message dialog with their pre-programmed dialog
	-Added collision detection for NPCs so they can't walk through buildings and other characters

In this version:
	-Added in display of items in menu and a way to select them
		-Use W and S to navigate the items
	-Add functionality to buy/sell items

In this version:
	-Made the citizens stop moving when in menu
	-Add randomized dialogue to NPCs, so not everyone says the same thing (need to do the same thing for the names)

In this version:
	-Added in system to change the deals a shop will offer the player based on who he trades with
	-Can enter into/exit buildings

In this version:
	-Overhauled the collision detection system
		-Realized the way I had been doing it was way more work than needed
		-Now shopkeepers only appear in stores and citizens are the only ones in the city

In this version:
	-Add in way for stores to restock items
	-Determine how to determine which store was entered
	-Eliminate issue with talking to people next to border (Done, but kind of hacky)
	-Added in leveling system
	-Finished collision detection with map, used getRGB()
	-Need to re-do buying/selling formula so you can't just profit on one item repeatedly (Done, but kind of hacky)
	-Need to stop NPCs from being placed inside walls/buildings

In this version:
	-Add in treasure chest that you get items from
	-Animate guards in corporation

Next up:
	-Have guards 'detect' you with their line of sight (somewhat working)
	-Make better sprites, mainly so you can see people turn
	-Add animated walking
