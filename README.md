Cities of Kyou, is a trade and interaction based RPG made as a term project for Introduction to Digital Arts & Sciences (CAP 3027) at the University of Florida. The game is built solely using Java and the native Swing library (in retrospect this was a poor decision, but helped me understand the nitty-gritty of 2D game programming).

## Instructions
Since you are using Git I assume a basic level of programming knowledge. I wanted to save space, so all that is included in the download are the assets and the raw source code for the game, so you must compile the game on your own.

Simply navigate to the 'src' folder and compile the source:

    >> javac CitiesOfKyou.java

And then run it:

    >> java CitiesOfKyou

Cheers!
